            <p>Foglia started like many other businesses, during the pandemic. Angela Pace, a
                former Pastry Chef at Eleven Madison Park, continously made kombucha throughout the pandemic when
                the light bulb went off. Foglia started with a 14 bottle-batch of kombucha out of a Sunnyside Apartment.
